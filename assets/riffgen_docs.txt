Riff Gen
v1.01.01
Developed by Alex Bredall


Riff Gen is a random guitar riff generator different from any others that
may exist. This is due to the program's flexibility and simplistic
feature-set.Not only this, but Riff Gen was built with guitarists in mind,
so the generation process, while still truly 'random,' restricts patterns
that are clunky or non-musical, while allowing room for the spacey
non-repetitive goodness. Simply determine the base note division for each
measure, the number of measures you want, configure your desired note
weights and generate a new riff!

Keep in mind that Riff Gen limits riff generation length to a minimum of 4
and maximum of 32. You can use whole notes or triplets for your base,
however, the longest acceptable note division are 16th notes. In addition
division base of '4' would refer to quarter-notes, '8' to eighth-notes, and
so on. Unless another input is provided, Riff Gen will use a default value
of '4' when calculating its next riff. Note 1, sustain, silence, repetition,
and flair sliders are set to a value of 50, while the rest of the weights
are disabled.



_________________________________WEIGHTS______________________________________
Each note weight is represented by a slider. A checkbox is used to set its
respective slider value to zero and disable the slider. Note 1 is the only
“note” that must always be present. The entry field below the slider reads
and writes to/from the slider value. In other words, these two are
bi-directional and one will dynamically update if the other is changed. Each
slider starts at 0 and ends at a 100, however, this is an arbitrary range and
these weight values are being used in different ways (read below.) Note
abbreviations are displayed above each slider. See the on-screen key for
meanings of these abbreviations as any notes with a non-zero weight will
be automatically loaded into it.

Among the "notes" represented by the weight sliders, there are five note
types: note 1 (N1), note 2 (N2), sustain (o)(must come after Note 1 or Note
2), silence (-), and mute (X). Remember that Note 2 is not meant to
represent any single note, but rather any note other than the base Note 1,
which is generally thought of as an open-fret strum. There are three
additional modifiers: palm mute (p), 'flair' ([]), and repetition (R). Riff
Gen uses these note types when randomly generating the base riff. Each
fundamental note weight is compared to the sum of the weights in order to
calculate what percentage of the riff should contain the note in question.
In this case, note weights directly correspond to the likelihood of that
note being selected.

Once generated, the notes are modified, first by adding palm mutes
(displayed right before either N1 or N2), followed by ‘flair’ and then
repetition. ‘Flair’ represents notes played twice as fast as the base riff
(i.e. eighth notes played during a quarter-note base riff). A maximum flair
weight will flair up to about 75% of the riff. Repetition simply uses its
respective weight to determine the size of the chunk to repeat (between
half the current measure length and a full measure) and how many times
to repeat it (this depends on the overall length of the riff.) This function
may often seem unnoticeable, but is there to provide an element thats less
random, and more human.



__________________________________BUTTONS______________________________________
The arrow buttons refer to size changes to the note division of the current
riff. The ‘Decrease Division’ button (left) will redistribute the notes in
your riff so that its note division is one value less than its original
designation, while still maintaining the original number of measures thanks
to the hidden riff cache. This means that you cannot generate a measure
with six notes and decrease to a five-note measure.

The ‘Increase Division’ button works the exact same, but increases the
notes per measure rather than decreases.

'Random' generates random values for every possible variable and
generates a new riff, while 'Add' simply appends a new riff to the end of
the current one - while both maintaining Riff Gen's note limits.That being
said, v1.01.01 does not support the playback or division alteration of riffs
once the add function has been performed.



__________________________________RESULTS___________________________________
The black message bar above the result box will display any messages or
errors on the left. If the current riff has any measure with a triplet note
division, the word 'triplets' will appear on the right side of the message
box until the riff is changed to an even base.



_________________________________PLAYBACK____________________________________
The playback menu beneath the result box is for both the audio and the
save functions. The play function will generate sine waves to represent
each note in the riff. Keep in mind that the play function will stall all
pending processes! This is Riff Gen's greatest weakness, so use with
precaution, because once it's playing, you can only mute your computer.
It is because of this that the loop function will loop the current riff
only four times. Eventually, you will be able to save this sine wave riff
as a WAV file, but for now the only option is to save as a .TXT to your
downloads folder with the name "my_riff_" followed by an incremental
save identifier.The black message bar will the live-update with the exact
file path.

The two sliders in the playback menu correspond to 'Speed,' and 'Pitch'.
As of now, 'Speed' does not quite equate to tempo, however, the tempo
does change slightly depending on the current note division. The pitch
of each of the three different note frequencies (note1, note2, and mute)
are all fixed to one another - so changing the 'Pitch' slider adjusts all
values at once.

_____________________________FUTURE_UPDATES___________________________________
- remove limitations created by the add function
- save all riffs to a cache or temp text file and add a back button
      in case someone misses their old riff
- change info to "options" menubar with a 'preferences' tab that leads
      to a pop-up allowing you to change the note symbols, shortcuts,
      and amount of loop reps
- add a tab to switch between results and custom riff with editable
      canvas to allow riff creation (opened text files will also
      appear here)
- save function
     - make cascading directories for saving?
     - make a save text template including Riff Gen info and datetime
     - allow .TXT files to be played back
- playback
     - add a save audio function (multiple formats)
     - convince audio player to not stall the app
     - add metronome
     - add spacebar playability
